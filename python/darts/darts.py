"""
darts provide utility to score the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total
radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and
the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same
point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).
